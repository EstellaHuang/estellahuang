### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=yx-hh/yx-hh&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)
I was a graduate student 🎓 of Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine 🏛 and graduated in Dec 2022!

- Now I am actively looking for a software engineer job, especially in backend and full stack development!
- Last summer, I worked at Meta as a software engineer intern for the Flow team. Flow is Facebook's popular open-source project used for JavaScript syntax checking, I was responsible for programming to upgrade flow from a standalone service to a distributed one by functional programming language -Ocaml in order to improve the checking speed and increase JavaScript Developers' working efficiency. 
- I have more than 3 years in real working environments as a senior software engineer in Shanghai, China, and have rich experience in java back-end development. I specialized in middleware such as Redis, RabbitMQ, and Concurrent programming. 
- I once participated in building complex systems, with R&D experience in large-scale projects such as CAF which provided a fundamental development framework for over 2000 DEV teams. 
- I also have the experience of mentoring interns and leading a small team with 2~3 people to develop a distributed Springboot project such as Document Search Service. So I am familiar with how to cooperate with teammates, how to figure out difficult questions, how to negotiate with product managers, and how to lead a small team. 
- At the same time, I can design programs and implement them with high performance and efficiency such as the online shopping cart center and SonarQube Scanning Platform. In my free time, I would hold technology-sharing sessions with others. 


I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains 💡. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ✨. Apart from that I also love to guide and mentor newbies 👩‍💻 I'm currently into Backend Software Development 🕸️ , Middleware development, Data Structures and Algorithms 🤓.  

### Things I can help

Before pursuing my master's degree, I worked for over 3 years in Shanghai, China as a software engineer, so If you want to know things like technical solutions for distributed System and backend development, Please feel free to contact me!
